            The Life Tracker App is an application that helps users track and
            manage their health and wellness activities. It allows users to add
            activities of choice for instance sleep, running and meditation.For
            each activity, you specify its measure of success. An activity like
            sleep could be quantified by number of hours while running could be
            quantified by number of calories burned or the distance. Each time a
            user performs an activity, he/she logs it in the application. The
            landing page of the app presents a summary of these activities and
            offers visual insight of the individual's progress.
